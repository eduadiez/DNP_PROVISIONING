Dappnode package responsible for providing a website to download de provisioning file of admin

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

This repository provides the way to run a website to download de provisioning file of admin with htpasswd(admin/admin)

### Prerequisites

- git

   Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) commandline tool.

   Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation). The community edition (docker-ce) will work. In Linux make sure you grant permissions to the current user to use docker by adding current user to docker group, `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`. Once you update the users group, exit from the current terminal and open a new one to make effect.

   Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
   
**Note**: Make sure you can run `git`, `docker ps`, `docker-compose` without any issue and without sudo command.
